### Features Implementation: ###
  - 
  - Fully and accessible customizable maps and characters.
### Complying to code requirements ###
  - Random encountering of procedurally generated enemies in the large-scale map.
  - Using structs to store player, enemies, objects, non-player characters information.
  - Freeing up memories as player leaves or enter different regions, by unloading previous region.
  - Saving and loading game status. Inputting of player, enemies, objects, non-player characters initial data and information from external files, allowing fewer data to be stored in the executable file.
  - Employing the use of custom libraries, by classifying, categorizing functions, we can distribute codes to different files to allow a smoother cooperation of different individuals when working in the same project.
